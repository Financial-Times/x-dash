## Very quick start

1. Clone the x-dash monorepo

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:financial-times/x-dash
    ```

2. Install dependendencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development interface

    ```
    npm start
    ```

4. Choose "Start the development server"

    ```
      ? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
    ❯ Start the development server
      Run the production build
      Create a new package
      Run another script
    ```

5. Open the component explorer
    ```
      ? What do you want to open in the browser? (Use arrow keys)
    ❯ The component explorer
      The documentation website
    ```
