# Creating a new component

To create a new component, start by running the `blueprint` script and providing the component name. This will initialise the component with the basic files required including a `readme.md` and `package.json`.

```sh
npm run blueprint -- name
```

## Help wanted

Currently there's no guidance for creating a new component. We'd like to hear about your use cases and work with other teams to make this process as seamless as possible.

If you have a component you'd like to build, and it's something you might want to get working across multiple apps, speak to the [x-dash core developers](https://github.com/orgs/financial-times/teams/x-dash/members).
