## Writing documentation

The documentation you're reading right now is generated from Markdown files and other pages are created dynamically using other sources from around the repository.

This website is situated within the `tools/x-docs` directory and uses the static site generator [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org). You don't need to learn Gatsby to get started writing documentation!

Once you have [installed] the x-dash project you can run this command from the repository root to start the documentation website:

```sh
npm run start-docs
```

Using this command the documentation site will be generated and start a server running on [local.ft.com:8000]. Whilst the server is running all of the files used as data sources will be watched for changes.

[installed]: /docs/getting-started
[local.ft.com:8000]: http://local.ft.com:8000/
