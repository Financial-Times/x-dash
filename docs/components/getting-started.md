## Very quick start

1. Clone the x-dash monorepo

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:financial-times/x-dash
    cd x-dash
    ```

2. Install dependendencies, this will link and install dependencies for all of the packages contained in the repository

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the component storybook

    ```bash
    npm run start-storybook
    ```

## Slightly slower start
